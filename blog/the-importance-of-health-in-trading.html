The truth is, many see trading as a mental or emotional game, or even a game of speculation and astrology, but not something in which physicality plays a significant role. However, if we are not physically healthy, we will not be in optimal health on any other level either.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="../images/cereals_pexels-alexander-mils-2103949.jpeg" width="620" style="width: 776px;" class="fr-dib fr-fic"></p><h3><br></h3><h3><span style="font-weight: 700;">Physical factors important for trading</span></h3><h4>1 Exercise</h4><p>If you were trained to help others change their mental states, such as being a psychologist or a life coach, the first thing you may have learned is that physical factors influence our inner states.&nbsp;</p><p>And not only influences, but if a change needs to be made, the quickest sphere in which you can make a change is not mental or emotional, but precisely physical. You can only stand up when your state has changed. Similarly, you can smile, and the chemical in your body changes affecting everything else. This is why after exercises such as running, yoga, or a workout in the gym, you may feel different, even happy.&nbsp;</p><p>The same is true for trading. To change your state, exercise needs to be a part of your day. It can help in more ways than one, such as your desire to control the market by observing the ticker, which we talked about as being related to crowd psychology and, for many, leading to doom. It can also help you balance all of your spheres optimally.</p><h4>2 Nutrition</h4><p>You don’t need to be a nutrition expert to notice how certain things you eat affect your body. After you eat, you may notice various things, such as feeling heavy or light, a spike of energy only to be crushed down, or feeling more stable, full, or hungry. These are all important since they can decide your level of concentration. For example, you may constantly feel hungry, making you more irritable as you trade. This may mean that the food you eat is high in calories but low in nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, etc. If you feel a sudden energy spike, your mind can become too busy, and it may again be hard to focus on your trading.&nbsp;</p><p>To improve it, one thing to do is start communicating with your body. Your body is alive and has its own intelligence. Contrary to popular belief, nutrition is not the same for everyone. What helps one person can prove degrading to another. Otherwise, why would we have so many diets? Understanding that your body is unique and preferences can change over time means that you are your own guru.&nbsp;</p><p>How to communicate with your body? At first, this may feel silly, although we communicate with our minds daily, but as you ask questions, such as: "What would you like to eat today?" or "What exactly would you like to eat in these cereals?", communication may be established slowly. For example, you may get the answer that you only need raisins in these cereals or that you should eat more greens.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, if your body is highly imbalanced in eating habits, the building of trust in this communication may take time since you may need to throw out all the junk you previously consumed first&nbsp;for your body to get a new structure. You can also consider getting help from a professional--not to tell you what to do since you are the expert on your body, but to guide you through the process of self-alignment and discovery.</p><h4>3 Enough Light</h4><p>This may come as a surprise to many, but the quantity of light you experience during the day matters. Artificial light is just that: artificial. You are a night animal, as much as you are a winter animal, which is to say, not much. Otherwise, you would not need so many clothes during the winter, and if all the light were gone, you would be able to see. By being on Earth, with rotations from the sun, you have a natural biorhythm to align with. This means most of the sunlight in the morning, with no light in the evening or night. Now you may ask how this is even possible for traders. Don’t we need to be alert all the time so as not to miss any big moves or opportunities?&nbsp;</p><p>This is precisely what most people think, but it is not valid. This kind of "lack mindset" is responsible for many bad entries and losing trades, not to mention accounts. A trader can choose when to trade. Even a day trader selects a time to trade, hence the name "day trader," not "night trader." Allowing the market to dictate the time you trade means you are not trading consciously, and it is easy to be sucked in by the energy of the crowd that thinks the same. You don't want to be influenced by a group in which 96 percent or more of them lose. Also, a day trader needs to close the day at some point and leave the market.&nbsp;</p><p>Those thinking that they cannot choose since some markets open at a particular time and close at a specific time each day, and depending on where you are in the world, you have the time you can trade; you can still choose to limit it to specific times. Instead of allowing the market to dictate when you trade, by incorporating more personal decisions into your trading, you may find there are fewer ways to be negatively influenced.&nbsp;</p><h4>4 Enough Sleep</h4><p>Many ignore this component, which research proves is crucial for optimal health. An example is a young CEO from India who died of a heart attack. It came as a surprise since he was doing all the other components right: daily exercise, nutrition, etc. However, he slept four hours per day. Also, there are similar examples of people who immediately go to work after experiencing jetlag. They can alter the mental state of illness from not getting enough sleep.</p><p>You may be thinking that you already know the importance of sleep. However, you cannot sleep well. Falling asleep is difficult, or you wake up many times during the night since your mind is overactive. Inability to sleep well means that you have some unresolved business in the past that needs to be addressed, and there are professionals you can contact for help with this.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="../images/rennen_pexels-nathan-cowley-1199590copy1.jpeg" width="620" style="width: 738px;" class="fr-dib fr-fic"><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h4>5: There is no toxicity</h4><p>Here I don’t necessarily mean air pollution, radiation, or chemicals, although these too can play a role in your health. However, I talk about stress and pressure. Toxic environments, be at home or work or just your inner state, have a degrading effect on anyone’s health. If you are in a space where your confidence is put down, or you do too many activities, stress will eradicate all the positive steps you’ve taken towards your health. Over time, physical symptoms can develop, such as irregular sleep patterns or chronically low energy levels. There are also professionals who deal with it, such as the toxic work environment or family and relationship counselors and coaches. I will leave some references below.&nbsp;</p><p>However, you can also take steps towards your health, such as making a space for a rest during the day, be that doing something you like, doing nothing, meditating, doing breathing exercises, or exercises for stress relief such as EFT. Over time, you may see some notable changes for the better, including your concentration, level of connection with your confidence, and intuition.</p><p><br></p><p>To your trading success,</p><p><img src="../images/IMG_8621.jpg" width="620" style="width: 620px;" class="fr-dii fr-fic fr-fil"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
