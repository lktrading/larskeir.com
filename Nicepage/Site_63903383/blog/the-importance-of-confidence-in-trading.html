How to prevent it? The answer points towards your own convictions.</p><p><img src="np://user.desktop.nicepage.com/Site_63903383/images/-man_successpexels-andrea-piacquadio-3779409.jpeg" style="width: 620px;" class="fr-dib fr-fic" width="620"></p><p><br></p><p>Research has been done on the topic of crowd influence, and it has been found that one of the most important factors is the person’s strength of conviction. Let’s call the person with a strong, firm confidence A.&nbsp;</p><p>According to psychological research, A would make the same decision regardless of what others say. The nudge in the opposite direction of their conviction wouldn’t work well. However, let's assume that there is no clear preference in the case of person B. In contrast to A, person B has no convictions. This may be because B is indifferent, hasn’t investigated the choices and doesn't care enough about the result, or is confused, has explored the options, but still cannot make a final decision. In both cases, a nudge can influence B.</p><p><br></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 700;">Loss of confidence</span></h2><p>How to know if you ‘lost your confidence’? One way to look at it is through the concepts of control and manipulation. As soon as you are looking to control the market to go your way, it means you cannot afford to lose. The inability to fail means that you only feel good when you are sure you will win, which means an absence of confidence. Note that this is different from your intuition telling you to exit a trade. There is no need to control or manipulate the market in this case. You are confident in your decisions, and sometimes these decisions mean losing a trade.</p><p><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.375rem; font-style: italic;">“Control and manipulation are the first signs of a lack of confidence.”</span></p><p><br></p><p>Since both person A and person B may be the same person, we can observe cases in which person A may lose their certainty:</p><p>1. Due to A's desire to be liked. If A sees many other people making a choice contrary to theirs, they may want to fit in. This depends on the level of independent thinking since it has been shown that people from different countries may choose differently based on their culture.</p><p>2. Due to A's desire to be correct. If A wants to be right and there is proof of previous data where people made a choice contrary to theirs that was deemed "right," they may be tempted to change their minds.</p><p>3. When A's perception is distorted. This is possible if the options appear to be the same, which causes person A to become confused. As a result, A may feel compelled to be correct and decide based on their influence.</p><p><br></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 700;">Trading and confidence</span></h2><p>Now, you may be thinking, "I don't care about being right or liked. I want to make money. " Although you may find this to be true, you are still playing with money, and you may realize that you are not entirely indifferent to your results. It is the difference between succeeding and failing. Asking for support from your family as you lose all you have or becoming a millionaire? Looking for a new job or a new Lamborghini? You get the picture.</p><p>If the person is only marginally interested in the outcome of their choice, the need to be liked or right is not as much of an influence. However, since there is no indifference in trading, these cases may play a much more significant role than you think. It may already be clear why, regarding being right. You don't want to make the wrong choice. But, what about being liked?&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.375rem; font-style: italic;">“The first step in the trading journey is gathering knowledge and skills that come from experience. However, success is always based on trust in your own ingrained wisdom."</span></p><p><br></p><p>Both wanting to be liked and wanting to be correct are mindsets. You may consciously not care if everyone hates you (after becoming a millionaire), but subconsciously you may still care. Our brains are wired to stay in groups and fit in since that helped us survive in dark past times. This means, in the worst-case scenario of losing the money, you may care even more since you may be reliving these dark past times in your own right.</p><p><br></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 700;">Conclusion and final thoughts</span></h2><p>Having confidence in your choices determines how much others can influence your choices. The influence from the outside can lower that confidence if we are not indifferent to our choices. In this case, the pressure to be right or liked can play a role.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Now, you may say, "but if I cannot be indifferent, is being influenced such a bad thing?" Well, yes and no. Yes, because you can be equally negatively and positively influenced, and in general, there is a lot of negative influence. By "negative influence," I mean the biased influence that favors someone elses' profit over yours.&nbsp;</p><p>And no, since if you are aware of it, you can learn to depend on your own choices. This notion can be scary, but I believe it to be the only way to become a profitable trader. It would help if you learned to trust yourself over anything else. This is not to say that you don't require proper education and guidance from those you see as positive influences. However, you are the one making your own choices in the end.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>To your trading success,</p><p><img src="np://user.desktop.nicepage.com/Site_63903383/images/IMG_8621.jpg" width="620" style="width: 620px;" class="fr-dii fr-fic fr-fil"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>
